            <h1>My Top 5 Games</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Minecraft</h3>
            <img src="pics/minecraft.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <p>
                Minecraft is a 3D sandbox where players can build structures, explore different biomes, and battle ferocious mobs. I discovered Minecraft back in 2012 and instantly became obsessed with it. I haven't been the best in building but I made many memories with it. I used to play different minigames, such as survival games, skywars, hide and seek, and parkour with my friends during break times in school. I don't play much nowadays but Minecraft will be that one game I will never forget.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Undertale</h3>
            <img src="pics/undertale.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <p>
                Undertale is an RPG where you can choose to kill or spare the enemies. What you do can influence the ending of the game you receieve. Undertale's story is really immersive and the interactions between the characters is enjoyable as well. The soundtracks are well-composed and makes the player even more immersed to the game. Its full of weird things that can make you laugh or feel disturbed. Depending on the ending, you can feel extremely satisfied, or full of guilt.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Terraria</h3>
            <img src="pics/terraria.png" width="100%" height="100%">
            <p>
                Terraria is similar to Minecraft in a way that it is a sandbox where players can also build, explore, and fight, but the difference is that Terraria is 2D and has a lot more content, despite the significantly smaller world size. Terraria has more diverse NPCs and allows the player to interact with them in different ways, while Minecraft only has villagers. It also has a lot more armor, tools, and mobs to fight. The bosses in the game is really challenging but fun to fight.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Cuphead</h3>
            <img src="pics/cuphead.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <p>
                Cuphead is run-and-gun game but focuses mainly on boss fights. It is heavily inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s. The boss fights are hard but is very satisfying when you beat them after a ton of attempts. I really liked the visuals and the animation of the game and even researched about the style which is called "Rubber Hose Animation". I like how lively the world of Cuphead and how even if the boss transform to something else, it feels natural.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Valorant</h3>
            <img src="pics/valorant.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            <p>
                Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter where in you can choose an agent that has a set of abilities to help your team win the game. FPS games has always been a blast to play, but add a League of Legends element to it, and it gets even better.
