# CS50 2022 Journey - Labs and Problem Sets

Welcome to my repository of projects completed during CS50 2022! This is a record of my journey as a programmer and my progress in the course.

CS50 is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. The course is taught in C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript and covers a wide range of topics including algorithms, data structures, and web development.

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed throughout the course, from my first steps in C to my final project. Each project demonstrates my growth as a programmer and serves as a reminder of the hard work and dedication that has gone into my journey.

I hope that my projects will inspire you to take the first step in your own coding journey, and that together we can discover the endless possibilities of computer science.
